ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! <br /><br /><br />

I'm Revati. Welcome to my corner of the Internet.

l'm a high school sophomore with a passion for programming, math, and all things science :) In my free time, you can find me playing my guitar, watching Ghibli films, or curling up on my couch with a good book.

That's all for now, but feel free to keep looking around my website! You can check out my blog, resume, or shoot me an email if you have any questions.

Cheers!

Revati
